## Introduction
A/B testing is a cornerstone of data-driven decision-making, enabling businesses and researchers to evaluate the impact of changes in a controlled and measurable way. However, without strict methodology, experimentation can lead to misleading conclusions. This project highlights the importance of rigorous experimentation and demonstrates key concepts through Python simulations.

## Why We Experiment
Experimentation allows us to:
- Make an objective and evaluate a new product agaisnt it allowing for data-driven decisions.
- Establish causal relationships.
- Iteratively improve products, strategies, or processes.
- Mitigate risks by testing changes on a small scale.

## The Importance of Strict Methodology
Following a strict methodology ensures:
- Valid hypothesis testing (e.g., null and alternative hypotheses, p-values).
- Proper randomisation and sample size determination.
- Avoidance of biases (e.g., blinding, control groups).

## Common Pitfalls in A/B Testing
This project explores the following pitfalls through simulations:
- **False Positives (Type I Errors)**: Detecting an effect when there isn’t one.
- **Peeking**: Checking results before the experiment is complete, leading to inflated false positive rates.
- **P-Hacking**: Manipulating data or tests to achieve statistically significant results.
- **False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: The proportion of false positives among all significant results.

## Common Misconceptions
There are several common misconceptions about A/B testing and experimentation that can lead to poor decisions:

1. **"More Data Always Leads to Better Results"**:
   - While larger sample sizes increase statistical power, they can also lead to detecting trivial effects that are not practically meaningful.
   - Proper sample size calculation is essential to balance power and relevance.
   - A different story for continuous metrics...

2. **"Peeking at Results is Harmless"**:
   - Checking results before the experiment is complete can inflate the false positive rate, leading to incorrect conclusions.
   - Sequential testing methods should be used if interim analyses are necessary.

3. **"A/B Testing is Only for Large Companies"**:
   - A/B testing can be valuable for organizations of all sizes, as long as the experiments are designed and executed properly.
   - Even small-scale tests can provide actionable insights.

4. **"All Metrics are Equally Important"**:
   - Not all metrics are equally relevant to the hypothesis being tested.
   - Focusing on too many metrics can increase the risk of false discoveries (multiple comparisons problem).

5. **"A/B Testing is Only for Websites and Apps"**:
   - A/B testing principles apply to a wide range of fields, including marketing, healthcare, education, and more.
   - The methodology can be adapted to any context where causal inference is needed.

## Addressing Concerns: Speed and Reliability
A common criticism of A/B testing is that it "slows you down" and that false positive/false discovery rates make the results unreliable. Let’s address these concerns:

### **1. "A/B Testing Slows You Down"**
- **Misconception**: A/B testing is seen as a bottleneck because it requires time to design, run, and analyze experiments.
- **Reality**:
  - While A/B testing does require upfront effort, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. Making decisions based on flawed or untested assumptions can lead to costly mistakes.
  - **Speed vs. Rigor**: It’s possible to balance speed and rigor by:
    - Using **sequential testing methods** that allow for early stopping if results are clear.
    - Prioritizing high-impact experiments that align with business goals.
    - Automating the setup and analysis of experiments to reduce manual effort.
      
### **2. "False Positives and False Discovery Rates are High"**
- **Misconception**: Because false positives occur, A/B test results are often seen as unreliable.
- **Reality**:
  - High False positives rates and high FDRs are typically the result of **poor methodology**, not an inherent flaw in A/B testing itself. Common issues include:
    - **Peeking**: Checking results repeatedly and stopping the test early when significance is reached.
    - **P-Hacking**: Testing multiple hypotheses or metrics without proper correction.
    - **Inadequate Sample Sizes**: Running tests with insufficient power to detect meaningful effects.
  - **Solutions**:
    - **Pre-registration**: Define hypotheses, metrics, and analysis plans before running the experiment.
    - **FDR Control**: Use methods like the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.
    - **Proper Sample Sizes**: Conduct power analysis to ensure the test is designed to detect meaningful effects.
    - **Transparency**: Report all results, including non-significant findings, to avoid cherry-picking.

### **3. "A/B Testing is Not Worth the Effort"**
- **Misconception**: The perceived high rate of false discoveries and the time required make A/B testing seem like a poor investment.
- **Reality**:
  - A/B testing is a **learning tool**. Even "failed" experiments provide valuable insights by ruling out ineffective changes.
  - The cost of **not testing** can be much higher. For example:
    - Rolling out a change that harms user experience or revenue.
    - Missing opportunities to improve key metrics because of untested assumptions.
  - By following best practices, A/B testing becomes a reliable and efficient way to make data-driven decisions.

### **4. "Why Not Just Rely on Intuition or HiPPO?"**
- **Misconception**: Human intuition or the highest paid person's opinion (HiPPO) is a faster and more reliable way to make decisions.
- **Reality**:
  - While intuition and experience have their place, they are inherently subjective and prone to biases.
  - A/B testing provides **objective evidence** to support or challenge ideas, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.
  - The alternative—relying on intuition—often leads to **inconsistent outcomes** and **missed opportunities** for improvement.
    
## Simulations
The repository includes Python notebooks that simulate A/B tests to demonstrate the impact of poor methodology:
1. **Peeking**: Showing how interim analyses increase the likelihood of false positives.
2. **P-Hacking**: Demonstrating how selective reporting can lead to misleading conclusions.
3. **False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: Applying FDR control methods to reduce false discoveries.

## Best Practices
As mentioned rigourous methodology is key such as:
- Pre-registering hypotheses and analysis plans.
- Using sequential testing methods if peeking is necessary.
- Controlling for multiple comparisons using FDR or Bonferroni correction.
- Reporting all results transparently.
